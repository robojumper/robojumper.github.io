Some projects I have worked on/work on:

* I created [DarkestDungeonSaveEditor](https://github.com/robojumper/DarkestDungeonSaveEditor): A save editor for Darkest Dungeon save files in Java, and [robojumper.github.io/DarkestDungeonSaveEditor](https://robojumper.github.io/DarkestDungeonSaveEditor) in Rust + wasm for the browser.
* I made a bunch of [XCOM 2 mods](https://steamcommunity.com/id/robojumper/myworkshopfiles/?p=2), including [robojumper's Squad Select](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122974240) and a bunch of contributions to the [X2WOTCCommunityHighlander](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander).
* Some XCOM 2 (modding) community servers run [steam_workshop_discord](https://github.com/robojumper/steam_workshop_discord): Python script that posts new Steam workshop mods to Discord.
* I contributed some code to [Destiny Item Manager (DIM)](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM): To help improve the tool that supports my Destiny 2 playtime every session.
